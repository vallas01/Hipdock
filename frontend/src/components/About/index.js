            <div className='aboutP'><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This journey began with a father-son project and a small basic computer â€” a Raspberry Pi. &nbsp; As an avid sailor who loves DIY projects, I decided to build a chartplotter that would show the location and course of our sailboat and also the location and heading of other ships. &nbsp; Displaying a chartplotter on a TV monitor would let me see where the helmsman is taking us while I'm cooking. &nbsp; That information would have help avoid a potentially deadly near miss collision with a barge<em> but that is another story</em>.</p></div>
            <div className='aboutP'>&nbsp; &nbsp;Fustration sets in quickly with the Raspberry Pi. &nbsp; Micro-computers like Raspberries and Arduinos are great for teaching kids computer science and for building small projects but for more complicated projects you will need to start writing code. &nbsp; As a co-op student I built a PC at IBM but that was 30 years ago and other than a couple websites, I haven't done any real coding since my college days. &nbsp; It was humbling to not know how to program the Raspberry with Python.  &nbsp; It was even more humbling to not even know what was Python!!! </div>

            <div className='aboutP'>The chartplotter came out great but more importantly I can now teach my son how to program the Raspberry P!!! </div>
